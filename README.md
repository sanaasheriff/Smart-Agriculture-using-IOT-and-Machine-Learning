The project proposes an innovative solution to empower farmers with real-time data on crucial environmental parameters such as Temperature, Humidity and Soil Moisture.
Working of the Project is as shown in the Demo Video.

Software Requirements:
1. Arduino Software (install the Libraries seperately or download them from the software itself, whichever works for you.)
2. Blynk Application (Mobile and Web)
3. Visual Studio for Recommendation System

Hardware Requirements (IOT):
1. ESP8266 NodeMcu
2. DHT11 Sensor
3. Soil Moisture Sensor
4. PIR Motion Sensor
5. 5V Relay
6. PCB Breadboard
7. 16x2 i2C Lcd Display
8. Water Pump
9. Battery
10. Switch
11. Jumper Wires and Straight Wire

Note:
If you are a beginner taking up an IOT project, Kindly ensure that you are buying the exact version of the component from your Referance Videos.
I Accidentally bought multiple different versions.
For E.g., Instead of Buying an i2C Lcd Display, I bought a regular 16x2 Lcd Display. Later I had to buy the i2C Interface separately and a breadboard to connect them both.
